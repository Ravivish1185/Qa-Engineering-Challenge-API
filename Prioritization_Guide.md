# Prioritization for Web Application and API Testing

## How I Would Prioritize:
- **Focus on the Most Important Features**: Start with test cases that check the main functions, like making sure payments work correctly or handling errors properly. For the Eneco website, the priority would be on tests for calculating monthly electricity and gas bills.
- **What Matters Most to the Business**: Test areas that could affect the business or user experience the most, like security features (making sure user data is safe).
- **API Basics**: For GoREST API testing using Rest Assured, focus on key actions like creating, updating, and deleting user data, since these are the main functions of the API.
- **Ensure Old Features Still Work**: Run tests to make sure existing features aren't broken by any new changes.

## Handling Changes:
- **If the Requirements Change**: Adjust the tests to make sure any new features are tested first. For example, if a new security feature is added, test that right away.
- **Keep Everyone Informed**: Share updates with the team and stakeholders through regular updates, emails, or meetings, so everyone knows the testing plan.

This way, we make sure that testing focuses on whatâ€™s most important and ensures that the website and APIs work well.
